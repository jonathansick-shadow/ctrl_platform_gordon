Work on this ticket is temporarily being suspended as the service unit for 
Gordon are going to be used by another group.  

What’s left to do:

1) Verify the changes continue to work.

Some of the changes here were done in another ticket, and then moved to this ticket to avoid mixing to unrelated changes.  I tested this last night, and it 
worked, but had been working in the master branch of ctrl_platform_gordon 
instead of tickets/2700.  I did a fresh checkout, moved the changes to 
tickets/2700, but haven’t had a chance to test them.

2) Coordinate changes with ctrl_execute

There are changes checked into tickets/2700 of ctrl_execute as well.

3) Fix “-J” in ctrl_execute

In tickets/2700 of ctrl_execute, the “-J” is required.  This should at the 
very least be optional.  The longer term change would be to have the job id
from Gordon captured, placed into a file along with the node_set name. Then, 
when the node set is specified, that job id should be grabbed and used, 
rather than having the user specify this on the command line.  

We also might consider making these sort of specialized “only for this 
platform” parameters part of the ctrl_platform_* packages in a parsing 
object, rather than putting all of that logic in ctrl_execute.  In other
words, have a core set of parameters that belong in ctrl_execute, and then 
check for additional parameters in a ctrl_platform_* object (if that object
exists), and have to platform specific information kept there.   An additional
object would likely be required to deal with how the command line default
lists are handled within ctrl_execute, to add these additional new parameters
(this would be in lsst.ctrl.execute.configurator.py). If we were to do this,
we would also have to think about how this would be handled in the template
files too, particularly in etc/templates/config_with_setups.py.template.

running from projects vs scratch

As I write this, Gordon is having work done on it's "projects" directory
and the file system for that space is not mounted.  I moved everything
to scratch during this time, and the files that are checked in reflect
that.  It would probably be better to run this out of "projects" since
that's supposed to be more permanent. So, when the ticket is picked
back up again move it back.
